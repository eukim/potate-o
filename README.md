# Potate-O

An old 2D platformer game I made in 2012/2013, uploaded my Visual Studio files to this GitHub repo. To actually run it as a .application, go to the "Game" folder. You need to install Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0, available here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914.
